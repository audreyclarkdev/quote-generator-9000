# Please enjoy this quote generator! :fountain_pen: :game_die:
It's pulling in quotes from Jachinto Design's [quote API](https://jacintodesign.github.io/quotes-api/data/quotes.json). The tweet button was more fun to build and use than what "X's" would be with the current branding. You can tweet any quote with this button - if you still have an X, formerly Twitter, account.

### (**Disclaimer:** I do not codone or agree with every quote that could possibly come up. There are real stupid ones, really opinionated political ones, but **more importantly there are quite a few randomly hilarious ones that are worth finding.**)
